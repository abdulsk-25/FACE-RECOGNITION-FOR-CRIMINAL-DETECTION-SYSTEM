# Face-Recognition-for-Criminal-Detection-System
Face Recognition Criminal Detection System
Project Overview
This project is a desktop application that helps identify criminals using face recognition technology. The system can analyze faces from live video feeds or uploaded images and match them against a database of known criminals. It uses advanced computer vision techniques to detect faces in real-time and compare them with stored criminal records to provide instant alerts when a match is found.
How It Works
The application uses powerful AI models like YOLO for detecting faces in videos and ArcFace for recognizing and matching faces. When you start the program, it can access your camera or analyze video files to look for faces. Once a face is detected, the system compares it with the criminal database using facial features like eye distance, nose shape, and other unique characteristics. If the system finds a match, it immediately sends an alert with the criminal's information and details.
Key Features
The system includes a secure database built with SQLite that stores criminal records, photos, and case information. It provides real-time monitoring capabilities, meaning it can continuously watch video feeds and automatically detect any known criminals. The application also features a user-friendly interface where security personnel can easily add new criminal records, view alerts, and manage the database. The system is designed to work efficiently even with large databases and can handle multiple video sources simultaneously.
